   Species and life-stage names.

   These come out of Ontario's stocking table in English. They are also the
   words a francophone angler reads on every single card, so leaving them
   untranslated makes the French build look like a translation that gave up
   halfway. Twelve species, four stages — the names below follow the usage in
   Ontario's own French fisheries material.

   A species that is not in this table falls through unchanged, which is the
   right failure: an English name is honest, an invented French one is not.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Forage species, and why they are hidden.

   Ontario's ARA survey records every fish a crew netted, which is the right
   thing for a fisheries dataset and the wrong thing for a lake sheet. A lake
   would list twenty chips and an angler would scroll past Iowa Darter,
   Blacknose Shiner and Creek Chub looking for Walleye.

   So the display drops three groups:

     FORAGE   minnows, shiners, dace, chubs, sticklebacks, sculpins, darters
              and the other small baitfish nobody drives two hours to catch.
     NOT_ANGLED  lampreys, gobies, ruffe, goldfish, alewife, gizzard shad.
              Not bait, but not a target either. Rainbow Smelt is deliberately
              NOT here — Ontario has a real spring dip-net fishery for it.
     ROLLUP   "Unidentifiable", "Sunfishes", "Moxostoma sp." and the rest of
              the family- and genus-level placeholders. These are not species.
              The card promises "tap one for its limits and season" and there
              is no season for Sander sp., so every one of these chips was a
              dead end.

   Carp, suckers, redhorse, bullheads, rock bass and bowfin all stay. The line
   is baitfish, not glamour.

   This is a DISPLAY filter only. Nothing is deleted from the data: the ARA
   record still holds every species, hasSpeciesData() can still see them, and
   the sheet says so when a filter empties a list.

   Durable storage.

   Trips, catches, saved lakes and recents live in localStorage, and inside a
   WKWebView iOS treats that as WEBSITE data: it can be purged under storage
   pressure, and Settings > Clear Website Data wipes it silently. A season of
   catch logs is not something to keep in evictable storage.

   In the native app the real copy is an ordinary JSON file in the app's own
   Documents folder, which iOS never evicts and which device backups include:

     reads  — startup fetches __storage/osl-user.json. The custom scheme
              handler serves it from Documents; on the plain web there is
              nothing at that path, the fetch 404s, and localStorage remains
              the store, exactly as before.
     writes — every save still hits localStorage first (instant, and the web
              version's only store), then hands the same payload to the
              persistStore native bridge, which writes the file atomically.
              Writes cannot go through the custom scheme: WKWebView strips
              request bodies on custom-scheme fetches, a long-standing WebKit
              quirk, so this half rides a WKScriptMessageHandler like the
              location bridge does.

   Newer copy wins on startup, decided by a savedAt stamp kept in both places
   — covers a restored device, a cleared web view, and the first run after
   this update (migration is just "the file does not exist yet, write it").

   Language, units and text size stay plain localStorage on purpose: losing
   them costs two taps, and rebuilding them here would be complexity spent on

 /* "Start Exploring" asks for location, once, on first run.

    v2y refused to prompt at startup on the grounds that a permission dialog
    is a poor greeting. Trevor pointed out that anyone opening a
    find-me-a-lake app expects to be asked, and he is right — the mistake was
    treating "never prompt at startup" as the rule instead of "never prompt
    without context". This is a tap on a button reading Start Exploring, on
    the one screen that has just explained what the app does. That is context,
    and a user gesture, which is what the permission API wants anyway.

    Declining costs nothing: every distance feature already degrades to a
    province-wide search, and the button behaves the same either way. */
